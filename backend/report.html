    <h1>HVAC Insurance Compliance Report</h1>
    <h2>1. Data Trends and Analysis</h2>
    <p>The analysis of the provided HVAC system data reveals several key trends and deviations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peaks and Troughs:</strong> The Absolute Power usage shows peaks around 12,678 W and troughs around 7,648 W. These fluctuations are significant and should be monitored for potential inefficiencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Delta Temperature:</strong> The Delta Temperature ranges from 3.59 K to 6.82 K. Notably, lower Delta Temperatures coincide with lower Absolute Power usage, indicating potential inefficiencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Flow Signal Faults:</strong> There are periods where the Flow Signal is marked as faulty, particularly when the Absolute Power is low, suggesting potential sensor issues or system faults.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Time Ratio:</strong> The Active Time to Operating Time ratio is consistently above 70%, indicating efficient operation during most periods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Key Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flow Signal Faults:</strong> The presence of faulty flow signals during certain periods disqualifies those times from insurance claims as per policy exclusions.</li>
        <li><strong>Power and Flow Correlation:</strong> There is a noticeable correlation between low Relative Flow Percentage and high Absolute Power usage, which may indicate inefficiencies that need addressing.</li>
        <li><strong>Setpoint Delta:</strong> Prolonged high Setpoint Delta values are observed, which could lead to inefficiencies and potential claim denials if not addressed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Factual Interpretation</h2>
    <p>The data indicates that while the HVAC system generally operates efficiently, there are specific periods where inefficiencies and faults are present. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Periods with faulty flow signals, which are not eligible for claims.</li>
        <li>Instances of high Absolute Power usage with low Relative Flow, suggesting potential system inefficiencies.</li>
        <li>Prolonged high Setpoint Delta values, which could indicate improper system settings or maintenance issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Address and rectify any faulty flow signals immediately to ensure eligibility for future claims.</li>
        <li>Investigate periods of high Absolute Power usage with low Relative Flow to identify and correct inefficiencies.</li>
        <li>Ensure regular maintenance and adherence to manufacturer guidelines to prevent prolonged high Setpoint Delta values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Based on the analysis, the building's HVAC system shows potential for insurance claims, provided that the identified issues are addressed. Ensuring that the system operates without known faults and maintaining efficient operation will be crucial for compliance with the insurance policy terms.</p>
